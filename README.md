# Endangered-Species-Biodiversity
### Scope

#### Problems
More than 600 threatened and endangered species currently reside in national parks in the United States. Learning more about the species and its location will help National Park Service better protect and foster.
1. What are the most common species in each national park? or as a whole?
2. What is the distribution of each species in each national park? or as a whole?
3. Which national park foster the most endangered species?

#### Goals
1. Identify the species category distribution in each national park and as a whole.
2. Identify the most common endangered species category in each park and as a whole.
3. Identify the most observed endangered species and their common names.
4. Find the park that has the most endangered species.
5. Find out associations between location and species.

#### Actions
1. With data analysis support, National Park Services can seek investments for staffing and management upgrades, and drive better legislations and science-based policies so that these endangered species can be taken care of.
2. Establish a community by reaching to the general public and spreading the knowledge, so people have higher awareness towards endangered species.

#### Data
I will majorly look at two files:
1. species_info.csv
2. observations.csv

#### Analysis
1. Description
2. Detection
3. Optimization
    - based on description and detection analysis, determine which national park and state should conduct more research on certain endangered species, receive more staffing. Which state should employ new policies, etc.
    
### Problems:
The datasets I used only include observed species in four national parks. There might be species that have yet to be explored. 
Another problem is the datasets only include four out of 423 national parks in the United States. Further research can include more national parks.
Thus, the analysis only involves the species that are recorded.

### Conclusion:
- Overall:
    1. There are seven species categories recorded in the U.S.: 'Mammal', 'Bird', 'Reptile', 'Amphibian', 'Fish', 'Vascular Plant', 'Nonvascular Plant'. Among them, vascular plant has the highest count, around 4,500.
    2. In all species with a conservation status, bird category has the highest species count for species of concern. Mammal category has the highest species count for endangered species in all four parks.

- Endangered Species:
    1. Yellowstone National Park has the most observations for endangered species, around 250 observations.
    2. Wolf/gray wolf is the most observed endangered species in all four national parks, almost three times more than the second most observed species for all parks.
    3. Mammals accounts for 50% of observed endangered species in all four parks.
    4. Fish and bird are second and third most observed endangered species categories in all four parks.
